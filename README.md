# Perl Learning Resources

[Perl](https://www.perl.org/) is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over 30 years of development. Perl runs on over 100 platforms from portables to mainframes and is suitable for both rapid prototyping and large scale development projects.

[Raku (formerly known as Perl 6)](https://www.perl.org/about.html) is a sister language, part of the Perl family, not intended as a replacement for Perl, but as its own thing. All the libraries exist to allow you to call Perl code from Raku programs and vice versa.

# Perl Tool, Libraries, and Frameworks

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a code editor redefined and optimized for building and debugging modern web and cloud applications.

[Code Server](https://coder.com/) is a tool that allows you to run [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) on any machine anywhere and access it in the browser.

[Perl Language Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=richterger.perl) is a Language Server and Debug Protocol Adapter for Perl. It implements the Language Server Protocol which provides syntax-checking, symbol search, etc. Perl to various editors such as Visual Studio Code or Atom.

[Perl Toolbox](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=d9705996.perl-toolbox) is an extension for Visual Studio Code that provides support for linting and syntax checking for Perl.

[Perl ORM - DBIx::Class](https://www.perl.org/about/whitepapers/perl-database-orm.html) is a powerful object relational mapper (ORM), transparently converting results from a database into result set objects (a group of records) and result objects (a single record) and back again. With automatic database introspection DBIx::Class enables developers to focus on using and extending these objects without having to write and maintain SQL, making development faster, maintainable and encouraging code reuse.

[Mojolicious](https://mojolicious.org/) is a fresh take on Perl web development, based on years of experience developing the Catalyst framework, and utilizing the latest web standards and technologies. You can get started with your project quickly, with a framework that grows with your needs.

[Catalyst Web Framework](https://www.perl.org/about/whitepapers/perl-webframework.html) is a comprehensive and flexible environment for quickly building high-functionality applications and is aimed at medium- to large-scale web projects. Catalyst has been designed with rapid development, scalability, extendability and maintenance in mind, including strong belief in backwards compatible deployment. Catalyst is based on the MVC (Model, View, Controller) design pattern, making components cleanly separated and easily interchangeable.

[Perlbal](https://metacpan.org/module/Perlbal) is a load balancer and web server, improving reliability and flexibility with the ability to add and remove backend servers on the fly. As a reverse-proxy server Perlbal sits in front of your application web servers, proxying the inbound user request, enabling the application server to return content to Perlbal and then get on with the next request, even if the user is still downloading the content.

[Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)](https://www.perl.org/about/whitepapers/perl-cpan.html) is a central repository with over 25,000 modules that allow you to find, download and install any of the incredible (and still growing) collection of Perl libraries.

[Rex](https://www.rexify.org/) is a  friendly automation framework written in Perl.

[Dancer2 ](https://github.com/PerlDancer/Dancer2) is a Lightweight yet powerful web application framework for Perl.
